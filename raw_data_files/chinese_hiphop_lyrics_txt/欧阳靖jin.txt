Yeah
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路
我愿意放下一切
If thats what i gota do
yo
零零零 从哪里开始
零零零 也不会太迟
零零零 从这里开始
放下一切
If thats what i gota do
yo
i been patiently waiting to hit the
stage and do my thing
well the time has come but guess what
i don't dance and i don't sing
ya'll already know I'm a MC! (MC!)
If you love the laidback flow
ya'll gota pick me! (pick me!)
决定上这个舞台目标是清楚
我就告诉自己一定要全力以赴
一直保持着练习生的态度
越努力越幸运永远不害怕辛苦
时间不够不是借口 小爷我hustle every day
1234to the zero 看破了but I never say
擦干了泪 关了灯睡 他无所谓反正也没有捷径 ok
尝试着新鲜感困难想要打败我嗯嗯 no way
man look at me now  got me here  I don't know how
All I wanted 从零开始定下了回国的机票
才刚刚上路 I do what I gotta do
曾经都 放弃的 过去了 怀疑的 全部是我的赌注
Yeah
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路
我愿意放下一切
If thats what i gota do
yo
零零零 从哪里开始
零零零 也不会太迟
零零零 从这里开始
放下一切
If thats what i gota do
yo
Ya ya ya～
roll a dice  从零开始 把过去编织 的梦都全部重拾
不偏执 面对 现实 谦卑 坚持 一切都不算太迟
like库里 遭妒忌 不服气 没伏笔 的三分
有目的 就努力 没顾忌 从谷底 的攀升 ha
争议的 质疑的 怀疑的 我不去理会
努力着 奋斗着 坚持着 时间多 宝贵
感谢那些声音让我成熟
带着你们的力量一直全力以赴
感受在我身后默默付出
我珍惜你的每次安抚
我曾经是个 超人
带领着团队 超神
让世界 特别 安逸
如今世界变得沉沦
身上的每个刀痕
都不曾让我叹气
内心不停 洋溢丧气
但不能放弃躺地
用尽了全力想忘记他
忘记过去身份
拾起了新的责任
不到达new level不回家
不去比自食其力收起脾气
没想过名利名次 请记住我的名字
我的生活是风格的综合
就像txt一直打着空格
力拔山气盖世时不利东南
跟我battle实力悬殊 天生攻守坚固
与生俱来天赋 根本没有难度
I'm just living my life
住在了编织的梦里
在舞台上
就像在练习室的空地
从不废话
人生正在changing
Everything so amazing
Everything so amazing
是你们
让我成长
给我希望
经验增长
学会坚强
背上行囊
解开西装
灵感释放
情感释放
粉丝心意
放在心上
在无数晚里梦过 ay
徒步前行在图书馆里
读不完的书里
I still on my way
Yeah
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路
我愿意放下一切
If thats what i gota do
yo
零零零 从哪里开始
零零零 也不会太迟
零零零 从这里开始
放下一切
If thats what i gota do

  这个故事开始在公园外面
  这个故事开始在公园外面
  1973真的很特别一年
  在这个时候有一个东西出现
  能够让整个世界改变
  来自纽约的布朗克斯
  有一个年轻人想到新的尝试
  Two Turntables Mic Check One Two
  他叫Kool Herc他是嘻哈的教父
  他主办的活动好像新鲜空气
  当时最求名利和财富并不是冬季
  生活环境不理想而不是哭
  只可以希望通过音乐逃出
  谁会猜到40多年后
  嘻哈的影响全球继续感受
  你想充分了解这个东西
  它的历史是最重要Indeed
  嘻哈是什么什么是嘻哈
  不管你主流或者你地下
  Yo只要你尊重这个文化
  我们个个都在同一个家

  我们是Hiphop 我们是Hiphop
  我的故事开始在厨房里面
  就是我爸妈开的外卖饭店
  十三岁我在那里做帮手
  但是我的心只能在想怎么走
  什么会那么引起我的注意
  一个还没听过的声音来自收音机
  Yo Yo Check It Out我跟着他说
  其实不是我找嘻哈是嘻哈找我
  二十多年后那你看什么结果
  没有什么能扑灭我里面的火
  会有负面会有正面无论什么事情
  说唱是社会最准确的反映
  拿着麦克风我会奉献我的生命
  面对什么困难我都会是那么钟情
  中国有嘻哈欢迎你加入这个家庭
  成为一分子我真的很荣幸
  告诉你
  嘻哈是什么什么是嘻哈
  不管你主流或者你地下

Hip Hop唔系净系Yo Yo声
你想知系乜等我话俾你听
1973年有个后生仔o系纽约搏出位
自己搵地方搞派对 入场费收得果鸡碎
佢赚几多根本唔重要 最紧要受欢迎
佢个名系叫Kool Hero
靠佢起飞 全世界第一个Hip Hop DJ
佢D唱片 根本冇得搵
但系系经典所以有新鲜感
间中佢都会Rap返两句
舞雷宫咁远D人都会嚟睇佢
睇吓睇吓实在系太好
跟住D音乐跳就变左霹靂舞
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
系十三定系十四岁掛
我就投入左呢个Hip Hop文化
大部份歌词都背熟晒
父母炸晒型都好难怪
听埋D咁嘅音乐真系冇家教
LL都话Mamma Say Knock You Out
佢话我一句我就学多一句
当佢耳边风继续有我兴趣
我著衫觉得自己愈Yeah
佢就话我个造型更加呢啡
牛仔裤跌到箩友都唔知做乜
佢每次叫我猛起 我都系话不
同亲戚朋友倾亲计
都系话唔知个仔几时变左黑鬼
今时唔同往日 根本冇得比
宜家我唱亲佢都话我地支持你
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
你问心果句美国到Hong Kong
Hip Hop界有边个為华人增光(边个?)
个答案系好明显 除左我有边个有咁既条件
佢点讲我都唔会停 咪当我MC呢个朵系浪得虚名
佢愈当我系水鱼我就愈要做BET嘅七届台主
我赢两次 你就话我好彩
赢四次 你个口就要改
赢多三次 根本就冇得拗
你未见过MC咁把炮
我赢两次 你就话我好彩
赢四次 你个口就要改
赢多三次 根本就冇得拗
你未见过MC咁把炮
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
拿 呢啲就系真正嘅Hip Hop喇
我下次详细啲再解释你听
你净系跟住呢个beat
跟住呢个beat得架喇 跟住啊

This is war but really tell me who's the enemy
Is it my past or am i running from my destiny
A couple laps and it'll probably jog my memory
It's all coming back to me now
I can't pretend to be
Unaffected by the trauma in my life
And it's not just me i had to watch my family sacrifice
If i could i would go back and make it right
Back to zero nah
I ain't going out without a fight
最新嘅体验就系做人低调先可靠
平时习惯将自己同其他人比较
呢种行为每日每秒都尝试克服
因为只有个人嘅突破先会令你成熟
我就系唯一一位感受到我嘅辛苦
所以无所谓就算要畀人低估
目标只有一个发挥我所有能力
就算要从零开始我都要做到成绩
Yeah
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路
我愿意放下一切
If that's what i gota do
零零零从哪里开始
零零零也不是太迟
零零零从这里开始
放下一切
If that's what i gota do

如果你是我可能你不会这样办
但你不是我你只可以刮目相看
有些时候不能只依靠预感
你以为我没计算其实我是相反
决定上这个舞台目标是清楚
我就告诉自己一定要全力以赴
一直保持着学生的态度
这种想法在脑里已经根深蒂固
一步一步怎么应付新的环境
最后会怎么样根本是命中注定
这是我的生命不是好莱坞电影
剧情会怎么发展是不能确定
我的真正身份是谁事到如今
没需要再保密我更充满决心
你们给我的鼓励是最大的原因
这次的经历永远都会刻骨铭心
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路
我愿意放下一切
If that's what i gota do
零零零从哪里开始
零零零也不是太迟
零零零从这里开始
放下一切
If that's what i gota do
Everybody wants to be a hero
(Everybody wants to be a hero)
But nobody want to start from zero
(I said nobody want to start from zero)
It's my destiny to be a hero
(It's my destiny to be a hero)
But i know i gota start from zero
(I said I said I said I gota start from zero)
忘记我的过去
忘记我的成就还有我的错误
为了尝试走新的路

lyrics
Written by Jin Auyeung & Tim Ouyang
I used to sit on your shoulders
felt like I had a view of
the whole globe right below us
I was young
but still old enough to know
that my daddy wasn’t rich
but you had a heart of gold
these childhood memories
are priceless
far from perfect
you know how life gets
when did it all start to go downhill
when I realized
that this passion
I had found’s real
you claimed it was the
worst decision I could ever make
to not chase it
was a risk I could never take
safe to say as I got
closer to my dreams
the bond between us
was just tearing at the seams
and so it seems
the war is finally over
I’m older but
still that little boy
thats on your shoulder
loving me is
all you’ve ever done
all I hear now are the
words of a father to his son
run a little faster
stand a little taller
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river
fight a little harder
fly a little higher
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river
sometimes you sit
on my shoulders
and it’s a perfect view of
the whole globe right below us
so much to say yet
words can’t truly describe
how I felt inside
the second that you arrived
a little bit of fear
a whole lot of joy
it still hasn’t sunk in
man got a boy
can’t even lie I’m
concerned in every way
I guess all I can do
is learn everyday
to me and mommy
you’re our number one
I often wonder what type of man
you’ll become
you’ll do great things
in that I’m confident
always stay humble
amidst the compliments
as for the ladies
save for the wedding ring
always put God
above everything
as long as I’m alive
my job is never done
these are just the
words of a father to his son
run a little faster
stand a little taller
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river
fight a little harder
fly a little higher
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river
maybe you’re listenin’
and you’re contemplatin’
cause it’s been a while
since ya’ll had a conversation
a simple call
time to man up
before you hit that last digit
quick to hang up
feels like theres no way
it can be done
pickin’ up the phone
and it weighs about a ton
but still not as heavy as your heart
tryin to make amends
not sure where you
should start
even if you talk
what do you say
its a scary thought
don’t let pride get in the way
what a shame
share the same last name
yet you’re strangers
no pain remains forever
love can change us
need someone to lift you up
when you fall down
separated hesitate
to tear the walls down
forgiveness can heal
when its all said and done
that goes for both
the father and the son
run a little faster
stand a little taller
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river
fight a little harder
fly a little higher
I’ll be there for you like a rock in the
middle of a raging river

The drive to arrive where I've never been
So if you're ready to roll then just lace up
And wherever you go don't ever stay stuck
Guarantee you'll make it through the ups and downs

多谢你支持 真系唔easy
一个 ABC 要照清楚块镜
佢哋想知点解啲中文会咁正
系咪有个补习老师 not me
由细到大我睇惯TVB
新紮师兄　梁朝伟真系有型
欢乐今宵　何B同郑裕玲
日头晚做就无得停
点讲都好　最紧要系你明
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
你使鬼理我边到出世 只要我有料
一张出世纸点可以做代表
我问你做竹昇有乜咁失礼
就算我系　你都咪当我食塞米
唔觉唔觉系美国住咗24年
我今年24岁真系无乜变
时间过得真系太快
好似无几耐我先至7岁　饮紧维他奶
如果我真系扮我大晒
有怪莫怪　当我细路仔唔识世界
你根本会唔知如果我唔出声
所以我今次一定要系到话过你听
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
你话我唔你正宗唐人　Who are you
距地睇我又咪系黄皮肤
虽然我哋环境系两个唔同世界
但系分别好少　你唔好踩得就踩
八月十五同中秋节
旧历新历根本就无分别
新年流流咪又系逗下利是
饮吓茶打几圈唔系嘅咪锄 D
欧阳靖究竟系边个
你真系想知　最清楚系我
简单来讲　三个字　边三个
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
You know that’s me

lyrics
I came into this world, broken
Bleeders, hard to conceive sin in the feeders
But that's me,
so I'm picking up the pieces, piece it back together
Find the peaces when I'm peach to Jesus.
Yes, don't wanna lose him from my sight
can't escape the darkness unless I find the source of light
I'm talking about the source of life that you provide me
Apart from you, there is not a single good thing inside of me
Whoever said, death is the end and that just the lie
We were created for eternity not just to die
Hate to admit it, but no longer in my scare
Yes I'm broken, not beyond repair
God I know you're there
(Caleb Lin: God I know you're there)
God I know you're there
(Caleb Lin: God I know you're there)
Caleb Lin：Bigger than the world
Larger than our fears
Hope for every people
You wipe away our tears
God of all the nations
Calling out my name
Beautiful and broken
You love me just the same
I bet there're times you feel hopeless
Maybe you should think about what hope is
By definition, the key to hope is trust
I looked it up
Listen, have a hope is the must
But more importantly,
I prey for lord will leave you touched
My faith is all I have,
In fact I never break this much
Feeling my heart get crashed
When I see the word distressing
Can't even watch the news no more
There is too depressing
The hate in that steeling
The ripe in that killing
How farther looking down
Just aging for his children
Quite the contrary
If you just think he doesn't care
Yes we are broken, not beyond repair
God we know you're there
(Caleb Lin: God I know you're there)
God we know you're there
(Caleb Lin: God I know you're there)
Caleb Lin :Bigger than the world
Larger than our fears
Hope for every people
You wipe away our tears
God of all the nations
Calling out my name
Beautiful and broken
You love me just the same
Heal broken hands and broken feet
Can heal the blind and save the weak
Then let my life and all I seek
Stay broken, better broken
Heal broken hands and broken feet
Can heal the blind and save the weak
Mc Jin & Caleb Lin: Then let my life and all I seek
Stay broken, better broken
Caleb Lin :Bigger than the world
Larger than our fears
Hope for every people
You wipe away our tears
God of all the nations
Calling out my name
Beautiful and broken
You love me just the same
Thank you lord

Caleb Lin: yeah you love me
and we love you too

饮啖茶 食个包 饮啖茶 食个包　
饮啖茶 食个包 饮啖茶 食个包
约咗十点半　十点半一定要到
咁早唔去饮茶仲有乜嘢可以去做
唔介意搭台嘅嘢食可以即刻到口
唔想搭台嘅就大约十五分钟左右
冇办法啦　宁愿等一等都唔想同人逼
我同你话晒大家都根本都唔系相识
我有你　你有你 　你饮香片我饮普洱
我地根本就唔夹　所以有得避就要避
饮茶根本净系得个嘈
最紧要系啲嘢食全部热辣辣岩岩新鲜出炉
饮茶净系得个嘈
最紧要系啲嘢食全部热辣辣岩岩新鲜出炉
饮啖茶　食个包　饮啖茶　食个包　
饮啖茶　食个包　饮啖茶　食个包
我地做个比例　如果点心系一套戏
虾饺一定会做主角　因为佢实在太好味
唔系点解次次出场先 都系去内场
我话虾肠唔系牛肠　唔该帮我改一改　
啲糯米鷄太热　所以我次次慢慢咬
唔该要一碟排骨　同埋嚟多两笼凤爪
啲蛋挞唔够热唔该你帮我叮一叮　
请问啲叉烧包究竟系焗嘅定系煎　
啲萝卜糕最紧要煎得好
最系上便加一啲海鲜酱就可以即刻摆落肚
啲萝卜糕最紧要煎得好
最系上便加一啲海鲜酱就可以即刻摆落肚
饮啖茶　食个包　饮啖茶　食个包　
你唔饱　饮茶有哩一下方便
可以叫碟乾炒牛河或者海鲜炒面
食唔晒嘅可以打包　做人悭得就要悭
等我饮埋哩啖茶　就叫个伙计买单
嗱　我而家就去一去洗手间　
上次你请　今次等我俾钱　千其咪嚟同我争
嗱 嗱 上次你请啊　今次噉系到我嘅啦　
嗱 系咪朋友先　系朋友嘅就唔好同我争啊
喂　大家自己人争咩嘢啫　紧系等我俾　
你唔系呀　你唔系搵交嗌呀嘛　
饮茶你都要搵交嗌　喂　等我俾啦
饮啖茶　食个包　饮啖茶　食个包　
饮啖茶　食个包　饮啖茶　食个包
name 饮啖茶

从漆黑走进一片光芒
绿茵中观看一片光
在欢呼声里 找到我希望
人海中跟你 农人浪
众志成城 凭著斗志永未停 步履带正能量
我要打冲锋 勇者不惊慌
磨练我 血气方刚
我追赶 我方向
追我 希望
我追赶 用血汗
沉着应战 谁未见过风和浪
My dream is your dream，your dream is my dream
it can take us down，break us down，ain't no iron team
For the goal on the green，for the gold choose your team
the crowd explode it's time to go,one world beautiful
世界咁大无可能比你玩晒
每次尽力而为 有时失败都唔奇怪
难得有个游戏咁犀利 that captivates your soul
究竟边个够劲输赢决定 that's the way to know
从漆黑走进一片光芒
绿茵中观看一片光
在欢呼声里 找到我希望
人海中跟你 农人浪
众志成城 凭著斗志永未停 步履带正能量
我要打冲锋 从未怕冲撞
全赖永远有你在旁
我追赶（我们的梦）
我方向（我们的梦）
追我（我会发热发光）
希望（世界会为我狂）
我追赶（我们的梦）
用血汗（我们的梦）
沉着应战 谁未见过风和浪
世界都观看着这舞台
全城也在凝望
看你怎挥发著光芒
全城也在凝望
我追赶（我们的梦）
我方向（我们的梦）
Давай（我会发热发光）
Сильные（世界会为我狂）
我追赶（我们的梦）
用血汗（До победного)
沉着战 寻觅我冠军理想

世纪婚礼 - 欧阳靖
这首歌唔知应该点写好
真系要经历过先至写到
我嘅感受同大家分享
开心到飞起 又有啲紧张
咁大个仔都系第一次
确实嚟讲应该只系一次
我另一伴唔系陈奂仁
终于揾到我心中嘅女神
佢嘅要求我一定尊重
再加上佢唔属于呢个圈中
冇人知我地系埋一齐
记者唔问冇必要刻意去提
始终系私事 仲谂住低调
点知打开C1竟然系头条
幅相有咁大放咁大
影到边个
就系我同欧阳太太
It'll be you and me until eternity.
I still just can't believe 一生一世
We'll have our rainy days but it'll be okay.
This memory will stay 世纪婚礼
我仲记得求婚那日
六月四号最正一份礼物
Surprise party非常之惊喜
所以将份惊喜还返俾你
戒子买左 虽然冇系身上
就算冇带答案都系一样
有人话男人流血不流泪
当时我眼湿湿咁望住佢
当住班朋友 查住佢只手
储够勇气终于开口
一时忘记同佢爸爸讲声
求左婚之后先知话返佢听
未正式系外夫我已经犯错
希望你大人不计小人过
绝对系我光荣做到你女婿
你个女我实会好好照顾一世
It'll be you and me until eternity.
I still just can't believe 一生一世
We'll have our rainy days but it'll be okay.
This memory will stay 世纪婚礼
我向你求婚 我求你应呀承
我对你情真 求你应承我
我向你求婚 我求你应呀承
我对你情真 求你应承我
It'll be you and me until eternity.
I still just can't believe 一生一世
We'll have our rainy days but it'll be okay.
This memory will stay 世纪婚礼
It'll be you and me until eternity.
I still just can't believe 一生一世
We'll have our rainy days but it'll be okay.
This memory will stay 世纪婚礼

lyrics
Yeah, I'm Chinese and what?
Yeah, you know who this is, Jin
Let me tell you this
The days of the pork fried rice and the chicken wings
coming to your house by me is over
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna wanna be Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps go off, ya'll gon' speak Chinese
Go f**k with your head man
I know a bunch of crypts that love Redman
Blood book in New York man things done change
Stop, the chinks be all over the game
This ain't Bruce Lee, I watch too much TV
This is a game of death when I aim for your chest
Too much sex got me seeing slow motion
Eyes barely open with a roach roasting'
And your girl, she loves the gin ocean
Rub it on her body like body shop lotion
What's the commotion, you never seen me?
The original chinky eye emcee
You don't want to step to the army
And Double-R rank refugee
And the battle of the gun is gonna make you speak
another language
And amigo I ain't talking about Spanish
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna wanna be Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps go off, ya'll gon' speak Chinese
This one goes out to those that order four chicken wings
And pork fried rice and throw dice
In the hood, you think this is all good?
Till the cowboys roam through like Clint Eastwood
I wish you would come to Chinatown
Get lost in town, end up in the lost in found
Eyewitnesses, you must be crazy
We don't speak English, we speak Chinese
And the only po-po we know is the pigs
on the hood out in the window
Every time they harass me, I wanna explode
We should ride the train for free, we built the railroads
I ain't ya 50 Cent, I ain't ya Enimem
I ain't ya Jigga Man, I'm a chinaman
Ginseng in the palm of my hand
She looks suprirsed in the palm of my hands
You know what's next? Safe sex
I'll be damned if I sleep in the flesh with the insect
(Jin speaking Chinese: This one sounds good.
Let's give her a call on the phone.)
Mr. Jin, you are the sexist man
Mr. Jin, I love the way you do your things
(Jin speaking Chinese: Really?)
Mr. Jin, you are the sexist man
Mr. Jin, I love the way you do your things
The moral of the story is
Don't judge a book by its cover
I know you think he's fam, but he's really undercover
I saw his name on the affidavit
It was written in Chinese and this is what he said:
(Jin Speaking Chinese:
The chinese restaurant is closing soon)
Bring about some local hooligans and thugs so
Catch them at midnight when they close the shop up
Reading the Ten Commandments, cooking up heckka
Movie small posters are all over the walls
If they think you'd save me the bullet, it's so over ya'll
Me, I'm just Jin just doing my thang
Just doing my thang, just doing my thang
Why is there beef everywhere I go?
I'm drunk skewing, can't we all get along
My ladies with the thongs, my thugs with the firearms
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Wyclef: all the ghetto)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Wyclef: all the suburb)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese.
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Jin speaking Chinese: di lo)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
(Jin speaking Chinese: Hurry, get out of here)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese
(Jin speaking Chinese: This one sounds good.
Let's give her a call on the phone.)
Mr. Jin, you are the sexist man
Mr. Jin, I love the way you do your things
(Jin speaking Chinese: Really?)
Mr. Jin
The game will never be the same
(Jin speaking Chinese: I already played the game)
Double-R refugees
(Jin speaking Chinese: Let's go home)
First Chinese rapper
First page rapper
Refugees
(Jin speaking Chinese: Chinatown)
(Jin speaking Chinese: I already played the game)
(Jin speaking Chinese: That's it)

喂　吓　未呀　未食呀　
你肚饿呀 不如你过嚟丫　
你过嚟我咪话你听整羊野你食
你梗系唔知我系　入得厨房　出得厅堂 好啦　
我等你呀　OK　Bye Bye
我的拍拖大约个零月度 我发觉你胃口真系好好
我的出亲街食饭你都唔怕丑 想食乜就嗌　系咁塞落个口
你唔系太肥　又唔系太瘦 但系成日话自己个身材无得救
好又一餐　唔好又一餐 我唔系讲紧听日
我系讲紧今晚 平时你话事　我由得你玩
但系今次你根本就无得拣 嚟代表你对我系几重要
我地唔洗出街　连外卖都唔洗叫　不如
等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵俾你食x4
我的间中都会锯扒　唔系嘅咪去食吓寿司　或者焗吓龙虾
生日　圣诞　情人节　我的多数都系会出街医
有时唔系太肚饿　我的就特登买一个order
然后一人一半咁分
食亲洋葱我就蠢　如果口臭嘅唔洗旨意同你打茄轮
唔怕　因為我已经準备左一包最新款嘅士多啤梨香口胶
试下我手势　其他嘅无得比
我包你一定会食过番寻味
等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵俾你食
等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵俾你食
加两滴麻油已经香过咸鱼　但系食神都话越简单先难煮
煮个好麵最紧要系用心　蜡烛我都点埋　你仲唔够冧
喺我个世界　你系第一
啲水一滚　就差唔多食得（得啦）
顶笼五分鐘　由头到尾　喺五分鐘我已经可以爱上你（系啦）
虽然我唔系乜野厨师　但系我好肯定你食左呢一餐就会知
有你 我个天永远唔会黑
如果你想嘅我加隻蛋都仲得 (Come On)
等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵　等我煮个麵俾你食

Written by Jin Auyeung, & Gilbere Forte & Rakib Uddin
he just turned 18
high school senior
book-smart
dreamed of the NFL
captain of the football team
prom King
mom proud
college bound
like look at my baby
he’s a scholar now
while the homies
was gettin’ faded
he concentrated
kept his nose inside
them books and now he finally made it
celebrated with the fam’
he the first to be
overcomin’ obstacles
and adversity
so many dark days
and cold, cold nights
but the future’s
lookin’ oh so bright
that’s why it doesn’t
seem quite fair
in a split-second
dreams turn into
a nightmare
he was gone
by the time paramedics arrived
ironically
the drunk driver survived
at the funeral
his mom just
cried and cried
couldn’t help but keep
wonderin’ why
then she heard
an angel sing
faith is forever
so right now, let’s just go
to where we lead the world (lead the world x3)
so far bring us home
we will never know (never know x2) x4
to Heaven’s Ceiling
we take this life
and bring it
home with me
to Heaven’s Ceiling
we take this life
and bring it
home with me
to Heaven’s Ceiling
she’s a mother of three
two boys
one girl
and a husband
indeed feelin’ blessed
way beyond words can describe
stay-at-home mom
and she wears it with pride
Girl-Scout meetings and
soccer practice
grocery shoppin’
and filin’ taxes
in the midst of all this
it’s still dinner at six
a picture-perfect life
ou thought it didn’t exist
it’s real
we searchin’ for answers
time stood still
when she heard the words
cervical cancer
hid her fears below
doctor said she had six months
that was three years ago
now the whole fam’ is
gathered at the side of her bed
only sound is
silence that’s inside of her head
tears rollin’ down her cheeks
she’s beginnin’ to pray
closed her eyes
she started driftin’ away
it’ll be okay
faith is forever
so right now, let’s just go
to where we lead the world (lead the world)
so far bring us home
we will never know (never know)
to Heaven’s Ceiling
we take this life
and bring it
home with me
to Heaven’s Ceiling
we take this life
and bring it
home with me
to Heaven’s Ceiling
I’m tryin’ to be faithful
for every second
I’m grateful
that we had together
forever and ever
I will treasure but
why did they
have to take you?
still can’t let you go
just to let you know
everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
God bless your soul
faith is forever
so right now, let’s just go
to where we lead the world (lead the world)
so far bring us home
ee will never know (never know)

欧阳靖&王祖蓝 - 秋香怒点唐伯虎
请大家而家听清楚
呢个古仔或者已经听过
但系我就会用Rap介绍
一位高人嚟自明朝
因寅月寅日寅时出世
故名唐寅点嗌都冇所谓
点解 因为佢属虎
所以嗌唐伯虎 唔系断估
江南四大才子之首
佢去到边Fans跟佢走
男女都咁受欢迎
有人就话佢好多情
考状元虽然冇出猫
但系考考吓都训着觉
你或者觉得佢傻傻地
但系你根本唔明佢心理
情人谈情话 过节要送花 古今都喜爱吧
缘来缘留下 世世你我她 就像两生花
情人如仇敌 爱上你太激
芳心必需要觅
情场从无敌 却要转角色
力敌美艳女色
讲识女仔伯虎系无数
去到边都左拥右抱
但系咁多对象冇一个了解佢
所以佢仍然觉得咁空虚
直至到佢认识秋香
但系秋香又觉得佢好“娘“
为咗秋香佢乜都制
混入华府做左人地奴隶
唉 咁就中左美人计
但系佢最想做人世
呢个美人真系冇心肝 不停喺到咁玩华安
一浪就接一浪 结果会点唔驶我讲
我Rap到呢度系时候闪
够钟睇秋香怒点
情人谈情话 过节要送花 古今都喜爱吧
缘来缘留下 世世你我她 就像两生花
情人如仇敌 爱上你太激
芳心必需要觅
情场从无敌 却要转角色
力敌美艳女色
龙凤斗花枪背後
情共爱藏在眼眸
龙凤斗招式太旧
男或女仍愿接收

你说爱我我却爱下堕
伊甸之初怎麽生了我
出走伊甸之先一早知我将有祸
我撇弃你世界里自受
不可偷的果子偷个够
吞一口得一口即使消瘦都接受
不需你又来犠牲
即使知我在逃避责任
怎可再度回复如原貌天真
人神共愤
人生咁多压力 你叫我点样面对
所以晚晚出去蒲 将自己灌醉
饮多两杯 已经乜嘢都唔知
冇晒知觉 唔知发生乜嘢事
临瞓之前 所有嘢都美好
但系瞓醒之後发觉自己身边乜都冇
谂起呢个过程 我已经想呕
唔可以呃自己 喱啲只系藉口
骗了我 那个原是我
我怎会不清楚那样傻
回想当初 那个才是我
我经已被毒害遗祸
像这大地之初 让爱重回在心窝
别再由神经反控自我
孤单的世代谁知错
感官都已被麻木捆锁
初生背着原罪凡人问怎可
寻回自我
点样行 点样企
个个人都有得选择 我冇资格批评你
我依家就用呢段Rap做个反省
系人都会做错嘢 最紧要系认
佢地话你系社会败类
左耳入 右耳出 你唔驶理佢
但系你要问返自己心嗰句
就算你有恩典 你识唔识去争取
骗了我 那个原是我
我怎会不清楚那样傻
回想当初 那个才是我
我经已被毒害遗祸
像这大地之初 让爱重回在心窝
别再由神经反控自我
骗了我 那个原是我
我怎会不清楚那样傻
回想当初 那个才是我
我经已被毒害遗祸
像这大地之初 让爱重回在心窝
别再由神经反控自我

我信有命数外我相天无绝人之路
我信我地继续做一定可以做到
漫长既道路踏着沉重脚步
纵然现实残酷 惟有向着上天祷告
生存就仿似生活响一个战场
步步为营 抛开懦弱 要学懂坚强
眼前既事物 无一样会系地久天长
你要珍惜每个机会发挥你既专长
每个人既生命都系一出唔同既戏
个个都想自己可以做到出人头地
点解俾人睇死 点样俾人睇起
点样系呢个社会里面做番自己
坚持自己态度 踏着每一步
相信呢条小路始终会通往大路
听日发生乜野事无人会知道
净系知道呢一刻 我地要企出黎做
照做 我有我地自己既路
照做 我有我地自己态度
照做 我有我地自己既路
照做 我有我地自己态度
一串光阴等于一串黄金
系边度跌底 就系边一度爬番起身
唔甘心 唔可以再等
黄金机会来临果阵一定要将佢好好捉紧
失败唔会使我气馁
就算前路茫茫亳无头绪
克服恐惧 勇敢去面对
成功要靠你地双手自己争取
你有你地自己身份
址紧守冈位做番好自己本份
就好似军人 危险任务正在执行
遇到敌人 死梗一样要奋不顾身
你知道你可以 我知道我可以
照做一定冇事 照做一定冇事
只要你勇于尝试 只有勇于尝试
有心一定唔怕迟
所以我地大家一齐照做
Keep your way, keep your say
Keep your motor running don’t delay
Feel the burn, feel the heat
Running on empty just feel the beat
Pedal to the medal and here we go
N02 ready and feel the flow
Eyes are burning, mouth so dry
Fumes are empty, still making it fly
I want to be there at the finishing line
Making it so will blow my mind
Jiu Jo is the way to go
Jiu Jo is the only road
Glued to TV screens all day
Got dreams but no say on the shapes they take
Destiny foreseen for a kid so clean
Who’s high on green but still so mean
Streets is watching, fans be clocking
The watches on they wrist be tick-a-tocking
Like a bomb with an unlit fuse
I’m ready to blow-up and get on that cruise
80 days around the world
See I’m dreaming again
Even though I get up in the AM
But it’s the PM that pays me
Crazy
One tour will get you some luxuries
It’s not the time u spend,
it’s the paper and pen
The words to describe
the struggle you’ve been in
I’m sinning
But only God will judge me
When I’m winning,
I’m grinning ’cause of the girls who love me
You see, in reality, it’s hard trusting anyone
Say they have a plan then they quick to run
You know the ones claiming they wanna be
But when it’s said and done, it’s the benefit they reap
Keep ya mind on the goal you stealing time
Don’t stop it rolling rolling till you put in that time.
If you sit back, relax and enjoy the ride
Then, the only thing gained is a lazy mind
You gotta step up yo skills in what you know
You got to do it day by day, everyday JIU JO

lyrics
let go of every sorrow you hold
watch the dead come to life
in this Valley of Bone
we’ll light a fire
in this darkness below
and the whole world will start to
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
yo
just an adolescent with a dream
my life’s a movie
I projected on the screen
and the storyline’s
borderline tragic
so many plot twists
I wonder how I got casted
then it got drastic
not to be sarcastic
when I say I found new life
inside a casket
I had to bury myself
my ego
no shame in crying for help
a hero
is what they wanted
I just wanted to deliver
didn’t mean to disappoint
no point in crying you a river
so I’m sticking to the lakes
that I’m used to
tender-loving care
for the world
and my future
it’s like I see it
in a whole new light
I been clingin’ onto what hurts way
too tight
I do have a choice
learned to listen
with my heart, not my ears
and I heard a voice
what was it sayin’
let go of every sorrow you hold
watch the dead come to life
in this Valley of Bone
we’ll light a fire
in this darkness below
and the whole world will start to
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
yo, at times
the glow can get so dim
things are flawed
and the walls they just close in
and I know home
feels like the worst place
don’t wanna stay there
for long like first base
it’s like a soap opera
seein’ your folks drama
thinkin’ why even get
married in the first place
on the flip side
you feel so lonely
waitin’ for Mr. Right
keep meeting Mr. So Phony
he says he’ll treat you
like a queen
yeah, barely knows
what that means
you’re a father of three
and hard workin’
tryin’ to make a honest livin’
but not certain
worried ‘bout tomorrow
‘cause you’re broke today
they can take your job
but never your hope away
you do have a choice
learn to listen with
your heart, not your ears
and you’ll hear a voice sayin’
let go of every sorrow you hold
watch the dead come to life
in this Valley of Bone
we’ll light a fire
in this darkness below
and the whole world will start to
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
I’m not sayin’
that the pain can be avoided
it’s part of the ride
might as well enjoy it
and it’s okay to stumble and fall
as long as you pick yourself up
it humbles us all
a million-and-one stories
under the stars
hopefully I can be the one that you call
through our trials
we can grow together
c’mon
we can make the world
Glow forever
whoa oh oh
we let it go oh oh
we’ll make it Glow oh oh
we’ll light a fire
in this darkness below
and the whole world will start to
Glow (whoa oh oh we let it go oh oh we’ll make it Glow oh oh)
let go of every sorrow you hold
watch the dead come to life
in this Valley of Bone
(I know things been tough sometimes, but you gotta stay strong)
we’ll light a fire
in this darkness below
(keep that glow alive)
and the whole world will start to (yeah)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
(if we glow together, we’ll glow forever)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
(if we glow together, we’ll glow forever)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
(I said we glow together, we’ll glow forever)
Glow (oh x4) oh whoa (oh x3)
(watch us glow together, and glow forever)

Shout out to the emojins, and the emojins only
Yo if you out here clout chasing I suggest that you just stop
Oh you ain’t heard?Watch the curve, there’s a new bias on the block
I know somebody getting’ cancelled if they dare call this a flop.What you sayin
It’s a bop, it’s a bop, it’s a bop
This is strictly for intellectuals please do not get it confused
If we ain’t mutuals then we ain’t cool.I don’t make the rules
Tryin’ to get noticed feel hopeless, but beggin’ that’s just not cool
Cause guess what all you’ll end up is like boo boo the fool
They keep askin’ why are you like this.Is it a mood
I reply in fashion being extra is，What I do
Adopting sons and daughters left and right like I was mad
Now you see why.Chance ain’t the only one to call me dad
Chance: I love you dada see you soon
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They shookt I know it’s true
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They wanna anti who
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,You’ll be wheezing when I’m through
Yeah I’m a skinny legend and this is my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Once I hit the stage, watch the whole world say uwu
Second verse,Shout out to my ult, that’s the wife
She’s oomf, plus she loves me irl, in real life
Tea for three, that’s my fam
Yeah, we wholesome and we happy if that ain’t relatable.Do me a favor please don’t at me
But this is where it’s at, if you want somethin’ that’s pure
You a multifandom go ahead cause I ain’t insecure
All I do is kill the beat. Chicken wings is what I love
Sippin’ tea, won’t be me you see crying in the club
This ain’t a come back. Just a fun rap honestly that only took a few minutes to do
MC Jin I’m your spirit animal that you know you won’t find in a zoo
Back to the facts it get snatched so fast,You won’t even know where’s your wig at.
Here’s a concept that ain’t complex. I did that
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They shookt I know it’s true
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They wanna anti who
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,You’ll be wheezing when I’m through
Yeah I’m a skinny legend and this is my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Once I hit the stage, watch the whole world say uwu
I know you could be anywhere in the world right now but，Thank you for coming to my ted talk
Uh huh I just wanna say，Thank you for coming to my ted talk
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They shookt I know it’s true
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,They wanna anti who
Guess who’s coming, guess who’s coming,You’ll be wheezing when I’m through
Yeah I’m a skinny legend and this is my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Once I hit the stage, watch the whole world say uwu

KT 觉唔觉得有d肚饿 半夜三更 揾哒地方坐一坐

我睇下有d咩可以医肚 我睇下杂志有d咩新料到
系咁揵 系咁揵
哥仔你本杂志好似未俾钱
o靓仔 我都未决定买边本
唔好意思喎呢度唔系图书馆
但系杯面就真系好多款 哩个咁细起码要食两碗
做咩拣呢个啫 咁多选择 um,呢个啦
你明知我唔食得辣!
请问仲有无 咖喱鱼蛋

Yo Jin we good with this one
Good lookin Kanye (whoo!)
You see we're the next generation of this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this uh oh
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi, M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college, the other never went
We take turns doing our one, two's and yes yes yalls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast yall
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
(Take em backstage, get aquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it coming to spittin G, I'm one of the best yall
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be,
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no!
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
I got a.. way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci parka, ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today (hey)
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got play-doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card, spendin cash on Rodeo
And me, I'm at the Slausson Swap Meet
Lookin for a pair of air 1 and white tee
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies, let's watch the bootleg
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
Or wore Ver-sake (Versace), all is too boozie
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that its on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin, why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
I got a love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
It's over girl i thought me and you was it
But obviously things ain't work out
And i know when you see this video
First thing you gonna do is pick up that cell phone go to J huh
name I Got a Love
lyrics
they say that
it’s the root of evil
I guess thats kinda true
just to get it
look at all the things
that people do
rob steal kill cheat lie
sell their soul
in the blink of an eye
just to see their dollars grow
I don’t know
what about the hard working
nine to fivers
trying to make a honest living
day to day
barely survivin’
bus drivin’
kitchen cookin’
cleanin’
takin out the trash
feelin like there
ain’t no meanin’
but to try and get some cash
go to school
higher learnin’
that’s what they say you need
in this society
we all tryin’ to succeed
what does success
look like how do you measure
the amount
I mean
is it solely based on
the balance of your account
if thats the case
I’m tryin to break the bank
I see you sittin on dubs
what’s up with that empty tank
to be frank
that’s just not healthy
you trying to get rich
man I’m tryin to be wealthy
if it don’t make dollars
then it don’t make sense
all the paper in the world
and you’ll never be content
whether falling from the skies or
growing on the trees
you serve it like a master
got you falling on your knees
Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money
it can change your life
in a major way
how much did
you make today
what about after taxes
what you got saved away
let you hold somethin’
I thought you just got paid
how you rather be broke
just to copp some Js
who am I to criticize
I’ve been down that same path
spend it faster
than I make it
no hesitatin’
I paid cash
that was my goal in life
to have the freshest sneakers
but as as I get older
things get much deeper
who’s the richest
not my business
never check the forbes list
all they ever do
is tell me you cannot afford this
money ain’t a thing
thats the motto
when you ballin’
money’s everything
when the bill collectors calling
in the end though
it’s not like
you can die with it
not to mention
all the things that
you can’t buy with it
love peace joy good health
these are priceless
never sell yourself short
no matter what the price is
if it don’t make dollars
then it don’t make sense
all the paper in the world
and you’ll never be content
whether falling from the skies or
growing on the trees
you serve it like a master
got you falling on your knees
Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money

When the lights come on
If you only have one chance,
To say what you gotta say
When the lights come on
If you were to die tomorrow,
Oh, what would you do today
I live my life
I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can .hold me back from my heart
Imma' ignite when i'm lost in the dark
Ladies and gentlemen
I need your eyes closed
Sealed tight ,
Don't think of this is rap
This is real life,
Just so you can know
Exactly what it feels like,
Going where you're going
But, it just doesn't feel right,
Stuck in a space,
Where you can't breathe, can't leave
Held against your will
Wishing you had hands free,
Just so you can find your way
Escaping from inside the maze,
Praying that eventually
Darkness will turn to brighter days,
Imagine for a moment
That you couldn't
See the path in front of you
In fact everything above and under you
Do you stand still or do you your best to try and stumble through?
or take a moment to reflect and
Let it humble you,
See life ain't just about the cause there's effects
The decision that you make determines what happens next,
Hit the switch, and you can leave the past behind ya,
But trust me when I tell you
It'll blind ya,
When the lights come on
If you only have one chance
To say what you gotta say
When the lights come on
If you were to die tomorrow
Oh, what would you do today
I live my life
I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can hold me back from my heart
Imma' ignite when i'm lost in the dark
uhh oh what sight to be seen
When the light hits you right
When it might be extreme,
Throw your shades on and stay strong
No way to block the shine,
This type of bright you better all stop in time
Its sorta like a light when it's flashing for a picture,
Paparazzi, never see it comin' until it hits ya ,
Unexpectedly, eventually, you see it change
Things that once were normal to you start feeling strange,
You realize the world is kinda upside down,
Time to readjust, plus we must shine now,
People all around, wanna know what's goin' on
Last night my life changed
When it came to breaking dawn,
All I'm tryin' to do is share how I'm growin'
When I stroll up in the spot, you swear that I was glowing,
I was never perfect, never claimed to be,
In due time it'll all be plain to see
When the lights come on
If you only have one chance
To say what you gotta say
When the lights come on
If you were to die tomorrow
Oh, what would you do today
I live my life
I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can hold me back from my heart
Imma' ignite when i'm lost in the dark
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down put it down
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
听住 Don't blow your smoke my way
我记得十一岁当年仲喺美国
屋企开外卖店 每日一放咗学
就准时返铺头 讲就话帮下手
通常眨下眼 就走咗出门口
所以话靓仔 始终系贪玩
群埋班鬼仔 成班都咁沙胆
个个大我两三年 觉得自己好坚
冇啦啦有一日问我食唔食烟
作为最细嗰个 又唔想失礼
吸咗半啖 就即刻咳到甩肺
班友仔就围住我笑
吸完之后 差啲惊到濑尿
返到铺头 阿妈问我去咗边嚟
我几惊 佢会闻到我阵烟味
我相信历史上 冇人够我快
一支烟之后已经决定要戒
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down put it down
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Don't blow your smoke my way
吸烟虽然唔经济 食完之后无闭翳
明知危害健康 我都照样吸落个肺
烟瘾一起 冇办法逃避
最钟意有团白烟 喺个口度喷出嚟
去到边 我食到边
有空旷地方我即刻点
大家围埋食烟 我第一个帮你点先
嗰度又话禁烟 个个叫我戒烟
我就话饭后一支烟快活过神仙
但系食烟原来真系好多后遗症
皮肤唔靓冇气做运动 已经足够证明
食咗十年 今日终于好想戒烟
除咗身体健康 仲想储翻啲钱
有乜嘢方法 去将烟变做垃圾
所有烟灰 唔会搅到污糟邋遢
戒烟嘅心 一定要比金坚
我发誓一定唔会输俾支烟
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down put it down
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Don't blow your smoke my way
我细细个我爷爷惜到我?
佢最兴打麻雀同食烟嚟轻松
所以食烟 同点做人系冇关系
但系无论点睇 都系伤害身体
你系都要讨论 Are you for real?
包装都写明 Smoking kills
白纸黑字 无理由唔识
咁点解要继续 明知无益
唔使吸你二手烟 都无咁衰
有时写明系 不准吸烟区
你都要点火 究竟搞边科
抽到行晒 好似嫌烟唔够多
理下我感受 就算系啲啲
使唔使玩咁大担 住口烟入Lift
我喉咙有问题 你点样弥补
抱住BB食烟 一定系最离谱
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down
Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit But I can't put it down put it down
I wanna I wanna I wanna quit
But I can't put it down Once it's lit once it's lit lit
I wanna quit But I can't put it down
Don't blow your smoke my way
Don't blow your smoke my way
Don't blow your smoke my way

Don't blow your smoke my way

Go, elite, yeah, Double R uh
Come on, Crafty Plugz, what
Go, what up Amaury, yeah
Go, yeah, let's go, c'mon
Peel off, if you got a system in the trunk
Shoes on your whip and you rollin' up a blunt
Peel off, if you wild, racin' for the dough
And the flag hits the floor and they yellin' out go
Peel off, if you see the pigs on your tail
Knowin' if you get locked that you won't make bail
Peel off, whatchu gonna do?
Peel off
When I, cruise the strip, you know that it's me
Split the crowd in half like Moses did to the seas
0 to 60 in 4 flat, make you look inferior
Funny how my throwback matches the interior
I ain't scared of ya, c'mon let's be serious
Bullshit walks and cash talks, what's that sound
My low pros burnin' up the asphalt
Drop top Spyder in the summer I'm good
Lost your words soon as you look under the hood
Twin cam turbo, your man's in shock
Only words comin' out your mouth, damn that's hot
Got a spoiler on the back every time I skate off
You thinkin' it's a jet that's about to take off
Cash and pink slips, whole enchilada
Soon as the lights turn green, you know that you gotta
Peel off, if you got a system in the trunk
Shoes on your whip and you rollin' up a blunt
Peel off, if you wild, racin' for the dough
And the flag hits the floor and they yellin' out go
Peel off, if you see the pigs on your tail
Knowin' if you get locked that you won't make bail
Peel off, whatchu gonna do?
Peel off
I got a, need for speed, I'm freezin' up time
Wanna, race the kid, throw your keys on the line
I'm switchin' gears, never brake for the curb
Cross the finish line twice before you make it to third
With a fly ass shorty in the passenger side
One hand on the wheel, one hand on her thigh
Y'all can't see me, peekin' through the tinted windows
Just to get a glimpse of Francine Dee
Let the, haters talk, I've been called rumors
See me on the cover of the Import Tuner
Lookin' at the skyline, I cocked for the race
Even got an Evo 8 that ain't dropped in the States
This ain't for no amateurs
Every time I roll through hot imports nights it's lights, cameras
Action, you know who's the headline
Do a buck sixty every time I redline
Peel off, if you got a system in the trunk
Shoes on your whip and you rollin' up a blunt
Peel off, if you wild, racin' for the dough
And the flag hits the floor and they yellin' out go
Peel off, if you see the pigs on your tail
Knowin' if you get locked that you won't make bail
Peel off, whatchu gonna do?
Peel off
Ain't a damn thing stock, you see the difference is
I'm a Pioneer just like your system is
Two screens on the dash, you choose the best view
Wireless control for the PS2
Skip the bullshit, and the foolishness too
They say we disturbin' tha peace like Ludacris crew
You want war? I'm settlin' the score
No lookin' back now put the pedal to the floor
Peel off, if you got a system in the trunk
Shoes on your whip and you rollin' up a blunt
Peel off, if you wild, racin' for the dough
And the flag hits the floor and they yellin' out go
Peel off, if you see the pigs on your tail
Knowin' if you get locked that you won't make bail
Peel off, whatchu gonna do?
Peel off
Peel off, if you got a system in the trunk
Shoes on your whip and you rollin' up a blunt
Peel off, if you wild, racin' for the dough
And the flag hits the floor and they yellin' out go

Knowin' if you get locked that you won't make bail
Peel off, whatchu gonna do?

lyrics
Written by Jin Auyeung & Diego Montes
my peoples keep their head up
in the truest display
do what they gotta do
just to get through the day
back in Hong Kong
where they grew up and stayed
until they immigrated to the US of A
chasin’ the American Dream
a ruff ryde for my pops
guess what
he still shut em down
open up shop
in the back of the kitchen
makin’ wontons
late nights out with my moms
playin’ mahjong
see I was a young’n
but the culture was inside of me
playin’ cards Big 2
never want the diamond three
every Sunday
it was part of the tradition
while y’all was at church
dimsum was our religion
I’m on a quest for love
that’s just part of my pursuits
no matter where I go
I’m always stickin’ to my roots
show you my world
that’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
cause for me
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but I ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but we ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday everyday
while we on the topic
I got something to reveal
can I be real though
I mean really real
cause at one point
yo I was losin’ sleep
thinkin’ bout the first song
that I ever released
lookin’ back it was a
lesson in my eyes
and if you never heard of it
hey that’s just
a blessin’ in disguise
learn Chinese dropped
things never been the same
credibility gone
charge it to the game
truly though seemed like a
scene straight outta movie
I was in the studio
with 1/3 of The Fugees
it’d be a understatement
to say I was excited
so when Clef said that’s it
I ain’t hesitate to write it
I was barely 21
but that’s not an excuse
I got on my own two feet
and walked into that booth
to make y’all proud
that’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
cause for me
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but I ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but we ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday everyday
roll out the red carpet
guess we’ve finally arrived
0% luck 100% drive
for your safety
I went through the crash test
life is a road trip
can’t rely on MapQuest
this is for my sisters
and my brothers strugglin’
here’s hopin’ that
you can find comfort in your skin
not better not worse
we just equally blessed
they say we fresh off the boat
yeah the key word is fresh
walk a mile in my shoes
feel the pressure produced
when you’re mentioned
in the same sentence as Bruce
Leeway none given
hard to fill a tall order
almost drowned in the hype
now I’m just tryin’ to be water
Chinese or not
this is for whoever will listen
listen we are more similar
than different
unite us all
that’s what I’m tryin’ to do here
cause for us
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but I ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday is Chinese New Year
gung hay fat choy
new day new hope
but we ain’t new here
lai see dao loi
everyday everyday

你唔够我哋黎就唔好喇屎上身(唔好)
一讲hip hop我一定会出声(声)
唔洗惊 欧阳靖系大厅(ah ha)
佢哋话点解D rap成日加我个名(Why)
仲要成个字咁大纹身系个颈(Talk to)
我同我讲 我皮肤够滑
衣家次次出街都做紧告白(Haha)
呢个答案真系抵死
I'm a Master with the Mic饮紧廿四味(Or)
我瘦咗少少自从翻黎香港
但系上亲电视镜头都加多10磅
你唔洗两头望 边度都唔洗去
We rap in all night long

我哋四围rap就要rap到你知道
为hip hop出一分力我哋继续照做(ah ha)
唔会顾虑系米另类只系为兴趣
我哋用压韵黎应对
系讲hip hop点会系一盘散沙
我哋大家都系钟情呢一种文化
最唔化都系所谓果D Hater
我叫你出黎rap你又话later
Phat: 有人问点解每次都预吖肥一份
有人恨featuring搵我做嘉宾
系时候听真 明眼人识分
唔需要靠我把口话你知边个系冠军
OK你仲未明 我好肯定
你觉得我有今时今日绝对系浪得虚名
Hater既心声战绩自有共鸣
得到呢一个罪名系Hater自己一手造成
我哋四围rap睇你走得去边
我哋四围rap睇你走得去边
我哋四围rap睇你走得去边

你有问题唔洗问米应该走黎问我马米
我冇家底冇地位成副身家得翻我手中呢支咪
我马米确系冇米
头先up得太快等我再速度减慢
我系顶班马你连拍马屁都未够班
想做我跟班俾你做已经系高攀
现实系弱肉强食只有强者先可生还
今日有欧阳靖同我连同廿四味
香港地Hip hop由边个担大旗

我虽然喺美国出世啊 un huh
但我都系仍然咁挂住香港 check it out yo
我记得以前细个听啲大人讲
九七之前一定要离开香港
我根本就唔识 所以无意见
回归十年後都好似无乜变
香港仍然系咁好
我返亲去个感受都真系好似解释唔到
一落机 就痴痴呆呆
好似时光倒流 回到未来
我已经变返小朋友
放暑假探紧我外婆拖住佢个手
多数喺公园吸紧新鲜空气
如果乖 仲有得去欢乐天地
或者去商场买下玩具
行街市我不嬲都唔想去
唔使买送都要兜翻两个圈
啲师奶见到就话 啊 你个孙啊
无错 个孙就系 我
眨下眼我都已经甘大个
香港就仍然咁大
除咗新机场 连迪士尼都起埋
唔知我老豆细个移民去美国
想当年 有啲乜野感觉
点都系中国人 就当系度假
离开个国家都飞唔出个手指罅
唐人戏 唐人报纸 唐人街
唐人需要嘅全部都有齐晒
2006最新嘅报告
老实讲我真系发梦都估唔到
我有呢个机会同大家分享
我啲经历 我间中都睇翻啲相
我第一次翻香港做Show
刺激过做过山车唔理佢几高
我已经算系执到金
我净系想你知 我 Rap亲都系用个心
除咗咁 I don’t know what else to say
我好开心我今日终於翻到屋企
so get ready get ready get ready
拿 老豆讲开又讲啦 其实 你几时来美国
1971年啦,我谂系咁上下啦
咁上下啊 你 你记得啲香港乜嘢
我地果个年代十四五岁 都记得好多野嘅
不过唔同你地依家啦 香港咁发达
其实我都好挂住嘅 果个年代咧我地去启德玩嘅
好似好湿碎嘅
咁你都可以话挂住香港啦系吗?
梗系啦 话晒我都系香港竹昇嘛 ABC来嘅
香港嘅ABC啊
系啊 啊仔唔好一味咁拍我博头啦 你问就问啦
唔系啊 咁你话晒系我老豆 我有小小压力吖嘛
咁你拍我博头 拍到我访问起上来我都惊,我都有压力嘎嘛
喂你有压力 我都有压力
我都好大压力嘎 问啦继续问啦
你唔好一味甘拍我博头啦
等我依家讲到窒晒口啦,你想唔想访问啊
想想想
你想访问就同我讲道歉先啦
OKOK 对唔住
道歉要握手先得嘎

Written by Jin Auyeung & Khoa Nguyen
I know our time is precious
so I’m hoping this’ll last
I keep runnin’towards my future
can’t focus on the past
but this reminds me of the first rhyme I ever wrote for you
here’s what I hope to do make every line a quotable
thats just me being overly ambitious
I do this for the people not the bloggers or the critics wait
could it be maybe I’m just in denial
been cravin’ for attention ever since I was a child
is it really a surprise I feed off of your adoration
when I step on stage
I’m just seekin’ validation
this type of transparency is quite new to me
never felt free enough to speak truthfully
learnin’ how to live and I’m no longer stressin’ fam
life is a teacher
but don’t expect no lesson plans
this is for the dreamers the thinkers the believers the lost and confused
the followers the leaders yeah
they say you only get one shot to make a first impression
thats why I’m twice as grateful when I think of all my blessings
great company great minds great times
wouldn’t trade it for the world if you need it take mines
see the big picture I’m just here to play my part
you are now watching history unfoldin’in the arche
many have tried many have failed
full steam ahead only to see their dream derailed
as for me ain’t no telling if that ship has sailed
I’m alive and well the details of my of my tale
there’s joy and there’s pain victory and defeat
what I lost what I gained
the bitter with the sweet
feel free to stay a while
take a tour inside my mind
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to XIV:LIX
feel free to stay a while take a tour inside my mind
and I present to you

去到邊rap到邊 去到邊rap到邊
Because I have a dream 就系總有一日我哋可以紅館見
紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 就算澳門夜晚穿都可以紅館見
我第一次系臺上表演 最少起碼十幾年前 肯定無以家甘自然
日日都卑心機 好好地甘準備 一首歌練三百幾次一D都唔出奇
以前緊張到死 以家唱一首邊夠喉 當支mic系手就發揮自己小宇宙
來到香港做歌手 環境好多野唔熟 見步行步 繼續發掘自己噶表演欲
點稱呼 隨便你 歐陽靖定MC Jin 無野叻 最出色系去到邊就rap到邊
商場 足球場 酒吧 學校 通通試過嗮 我琴晚發夢開紅館 D 飛大賣
去到邊rap到邊 去到邊rap到邊
Because I have a dream 就系總有一日我哋可以紅館見
紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 就算澳門夜晚穿都可以紅館見
細細個來香港玩 我仲記得 經過好幾次都唔知 兩面系乜
四四方方 形狀有D似個碗 爭對筷子 原來就系紅磡體育館
除佐體育館 仲有明星唱歌 其實 香港呢種地方真系唔多
博覽館系適合大型噶表演 但系 仲遠過機場一D都唔方便
系紅館開show 系特別hight hight hight
做sammi嘉賓個幾次真系hight hight hight
好榮幸可以同距唱信者得愛 但系每次首歌完我都唔捨得落臺
去到邊rap到邊 去到邊rap到邊
Because I have a dream 就系總有一日我哋可以紅館見
紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 就算澳門夜晚穿都可以紅館見
繼續發夢 希望個個來睇 坐滿曬一萬二千五百個位
就算正系開三面臺都幾大 但系開四面就360度都見曬
又畏高 坐山頂小心會嘔 扼手位 緊系留翻卑親戚朋友
卑D掌聲 大聲D 我哋今晚所有dancer同排舞老師
今晚D歌系米特別好聽 甘卑D掌聲 我哋對band
我想問 邊個系自己買飛 甘卑D掌聲 你哋自己
去到邊rap到邊 去到邊rap到邊
Because I have a dream 就系總有一日我哋可以紅館見
紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 我哋 我哋紅館見 就算澳門夜晚穿都可以紅館見

二零零八年六月十号
由美国出发 香港终于 导步
正式出碟进入呢个乐坛
追求梦想 克服阻难
同经理人商量 考虑成点
一个决定 就将我人生改变
应付新的环境实有难度
所以就决定见步行步
大家好吗 我哋又见面
眨下眼嚟咗香港差唔多三年
十个有十个喺我接触嘅人
有一个问题喺必定会问
阿Jin喺美国发展好哋哋
点解无端端会走番嚟
点样先为之无端端
我当初番嚟唔喺搵窿钻
我喺ABC 但喺讲真
每一颗树都有佢树根
人嘅生命根本喺一个故事
咁啱我果个就喺呢度开始
我仲记得纽约临走之前
阿妈阿嫲比我嘅意见
做翻自己唔好太得戚
记住唔识千其唔好扮识
佢哋呢番说话我当正喺金
所以我每日都keep住喺心
今次呢个经历真喺唔同
唯有用多姿多彩嚟形容
会有咁嘅机会我霖都无霖
比到我最大嘅满足感
唔喺名气亦都唔喺银纸
就喺大家当咗我喺一份子~~~
唔介意嘅可以follow我sina微博 Junizzz

lyrics
can you believe it?
a whole decade has gone by
since I dropped my first album
man, time flies
where does it go?
nobody knows
I appreciate you all for comin’
to the shows
just to get front row
so that I can see your sign
showin’ up hours early
didn’t even mind
‘cause when I hit the stage
nothing else mattered
we were on Cloud Nine
‘til my dreams got shattered
felt like the
spotlight faded overnight
I can only blame myself
‘cause I fed into the hype
couldn’t admit it hurt
the game was so intense
they threw dirt on my name
but you came to my defense
some abandoned ship
but you stuck around
even supported the projects
I put out underground
as far as my career
it’s like I crash and survived
all these years it was you
that kept my passion alive
you’re more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family
they talk about it
like it was just yesterday
overwhelmed by the love
that they sent my way
you know what blows my mind
when they say
Jin, I remember
I was in the 7th grade
I used to watch you every week
I was so amazed
up there to compete
man, it felt like I
was on that stage
and when you got signed
I got signed too
yeah, that’s why
I’ll always stand behind you
see that was something
I was not prepared for
still figurin’ things out for myself
therefore
all the songs
about gettin’ drunk
and smokin’ up
never crossed my mind
the messages you were soakin’ up
didn’t realize where I was
‘til I was in it
truth is
that was never me to begin with
hopefully we’ll be
face-to-face some day
and we’ll both see
how we’ve come
such a long way
you’re more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family
let’s connect
that’s exactly why I came
showin’ love
want a hug
take a picture
sign my name
sure thing
as long as I ain’t in a hurrry
can always retake it
if the picture looks blurry
hands shakin’
hey, no need to be nervous
take a deep breath “huh”
none of us are perfect
I know you
might have expectations
but I’m just a man
not to be idolized
I hope you understand
so feel free
to take me off that pedestal
I’d rather see you eye-to-eye
now there’s a better view
we have lots in common
and all of it is real
share the same emotions
that life can make you feel
your support is unconditional
they don’t understand it
between me and you
I will not take it for granted
reach out anytime
send a email
nofanzone
that’s my Gmail
you’re more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family
ahh yeaah

Hip Hop唔系净系Yo Yo声
你想知系乜等我话俾你听
1973年有个后生仔o系纽约搏出位
自己搵地方搞派对 入场费收得果鸡碎
佢赚几多根本唔重要 最紧要受欢迎
佢个名系叫Kool Hero
靠佢起飞 全世界第一个Hip Hop DJ
佢D唱片 根本冇得搵
但系系经典所以有新鲜感
间中佢都会Rap返两句
舞雷宫咁远D人都会嚟睇佢
睇吓睇吓实在系太好
跟住D音乐跳就变左霹靂舞
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
系十三定系十四岁掛
我就投入左呢个Hip Hop文化
大部份歌词都背熟晒
父母炸晒型都好难怪
听埋D咁嘅音乐真系冇家教
LL都话Mamma Say Knock You Out
佢话我一句我就学多一句
当佢耳边风继续有我兴趣
我著衫觉得自己愈Yeah
佢就话我个造型更加呢啡
牛仔裤跌到箩友都唔知做乜
佢每次叫我猛起 我都系话不
同亲戚朋友倾亲计
都系话唔知个仔几时变左黑鬼
今时唔同往日 根本冇得比
宜家我唱亲佢都话我地支持你
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
Yo Yo Yo It’s Hip Hop
Yes Yes Yo It’s Hip Hop
So So Fresh it’s Hip Hop
Hey yo Don’t Stop
你问心果句美国到Hong Kong
Hip Hop界有边个為华人增光(边个?)
个答案系好明显 除左我有边个有咁既条件
佢点讲我都唔会停 咪当我MC呢个朵系浪得虚名
佢愈当我系水鱼我就愈要做BET嘅七届台主
我赢两次 你就话我好彩
赢四次 你个口就要改
赢多三次 根本就冇得拗
你未见过MC咁把炮
我赢两次 你就话我好彩
赢四次 你个口就要改
赢多三次 根本就冇得拗

我下次详细啲再解释你听

Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now ma whole set get love
I'm in the Chi two steppin wit them thugs
And big man you can search all you want
But you ain't gon' find no drugs or no guns
Yea y'all can get weeded up, beated up
But don't eat it up this ain't a slow jam so I can speed it up （lets go）
I ain't sparkin a meadow
I jus want to talk to the ghetto
Bag the baddest chick with the sharpest stilettos
Im so influential, you so impotential
Man you gon' know what I'm workin wit
When I hold it against you
Destination vip you can follow us
But if it was the last sip well jus follow us
Shorty feelin my style because I'm humerous
Put me on cloud nine and its accumulous
Assume its us Jin, mista quick to diss ya
And Twista spit so fast ya lips'll blista
Now I get high get low （get low）
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt （like this）
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now I get high get low （get low）
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt （like this）
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
When I come in the party betta get high
Cuz I pulled up in the platinum seven six five
Who say lyrical niggaz don't know how to party
See me jackin up shawtys wit a grippin on her thick thighs
I like the way she workin that badunkadunk
Bouncin the fatty when the base go bump
She witness how Twista spit it
So now she want me to hit it
Cuz I'm blazin up the booth and raisin up the roof
I'm in the vip sippin on Cris' and Henn'
All the ladies is trippin cuz they can't get in
They see me ballin wit the Ruff Ryder homie
And say they only drink liqour nigga but now they want some Jin
Everywhere we kick it we got the club sold
International hustlas that travel the globe
Rockin the thugs makin hoes keep it live
It's the Double R connect and that nigga Twista from Chi
I'm fly
Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
We can definately kick it
I don't want to just stick it
If bein fine was a crime well I'd havta write you up a ticket
If you dance for me its sign jus like a picket
And I got two middle fingaz for all you critics
Never you in this someone so clever who spit this
I'm only here for one night so I mix some pleasure with buisness
Every few minutes
I drink a couple of shots
Take a dutch break it in half and fill it up with some pot
Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now I get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love
Now mama shake some

Yo mama work some
If they don't like it **** it
They some haters （jus work it girl）
Now mama shake some
If they don't like it **** it

Yo mama work some
If they don't like it **** it

And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love

lyrics
granted feel free to send it back
I’d like to take this moment
to tell y’all how I came up
but
first let me tell y’all where I came from
in North Miami Beach born and raised
on the grind is how I spent most of my days
chillin’ out maxin’ relaxin’ coolin’
kickin’ freestyles outside of my school and
before LL was in the house
I picked up the mic mama almost knocked me out
not a new jack you ain’t get the memo wait
98 I was on my third demotape
no YouTube views no Instagram
had to hit that stage to convince the fans
won’t lie got booed maybe once or twice
never again I must’ve been doin’somethin’ right
could it be my desire Hunger Games
I’m a one of one you will find none the same
with skills required like you have never seen
I got that fire Katniss Everdeen
to get signed show up in headlines
labels slept for a while bedtime
til I hit ‘em with that wake up call
911 emergency wake up y’all
Plan A don’t stop til they know my name
Plan B was simple see Plan A
gotta stay focused to overcome what’s tough
that’s just how it is when you’re comin’ up
I know you see me comin’ up
I know you see me comin’ up
that’s what’s up
I’m a father now I love story time
ready for it? here’s a Toy Story line
they say where you been Jin I been right here
just buildin’ up my buzz for a light year
startin’ from scratch somethin’ fresh indeed
cookin’ up tracks got a new recipe
a little bit of this and a little of that let it sit in the booth for 30 minutes ,and it’s a wrap
the delivery is flawless when I spit it ,that’s a fact
if it isn’t permission
shout out to Twista a vet fasho ,we did a song together
 and never met before,sometimes that’s just how the game goes
no pot of gold at the end of rainbows
pockets not quite at the proper calorie yet
my biggest payout cashing a reality check
but the last thing I’m doin’ though is prayin’ for wealth
cause I love the Lord way,before anything else in the meantime
yo I got business to do ‘bout to kill it all that’s left is my finishin’ move stayin’
composed while I’m still in control
tryin’to sellout these shows without sellin’ my soul
I seen the highs and the lows just to sum it up
that’s always how it is when you’re comin’ up
I know you see me comin’ up
that’s what’s up
ahh yeaah
here’s the best part
the come up gotta enjoy it
check me out
yo I’m comin’ up nah I ain’t lookin’ down
I’m comin’ up nah I ain’t lookin’ down
at this rate I won’t even see the ground
at this rate I won’t even see the ground
change the game thats what I came to
do change the game that’s what I came to do
change the game don’t let it change you
change the game ,don’t let it change change, change you, you, you

I don't know what you want from me
你估想升真系话咁易
有所不知　最紧要支持
人气急升　大家冷静
我曾经出过一首歌
话想做个Hong Kong Super Star
有吴彦祖客串Rap两嘴
拍MV所有女士都　实佢
仲上埋报纸　个标题
Daniel Wu昨日同个纹身肥仔
喺铜锣湾Lun埋班Friend
我唔识睇中文
都系friend读番俾我听
唔知我听错　定系未瞓醒
纹身肥仔喂我都有名
仲纹喺条颈　冇需要去捽
信我啦真架　终於水落石出
我开始明白　个游戏规则
唔识我唔系罪　咪由得佢噏
星始终系星　无论系几细粒
坦白讲我都估唔到会升得咁急
I don't know what you want from me
你估想升真系话咁易
有所不知　最紧要支持
人气急升　大家冷静
我Rap嘅歌就比较轻松
话想拍广告又比我讲中
接完一单又一单真系咁笋
六合彩号码又唔见我咁准
喺香港做artist都几过瘾
最需要曝光嘅就通常冇份
以前出function都人哋影先
而家相机多到唔知应该望边
多咗fans仲有埋灯牌
唯有轮流咁用　因为夹钱去买
好鬼感激你哋次次大嗌
但系有时我rap啲拍子搞到乱晒
点同记者沟通要谂下办法
问嘅问题都唔知应该点答
觉唔觉得自己越嚟越红
就算系我都冇咁蠢去认同
I don't know what you want from me
你估想升真系话咁易
有所不知　最紧要支持
人气急升　大家冷静
有你支持（我会支持）
我会坚持（继续坚持）
终於得到（终於得到）
双手举高（WOW）
有你支持（我会支持）
我会坚持（继续坚持）
我会继续升
继续咁升就快到屋顶
假设如果我听朝瞓醒
冇人理我就算跌咗落个井
假设呀冇人要我签名
冇成班人争住嚟影相
你问我情绪会唔会受到影响
趁未有人知我自己通街唱
此地无银三百両
就算你话永远都支持
今日真系唔知听日嘅事
我唯有抱住呢个心态
我宁愿逐步行好过升得咁快
但系有一样嘢系好肯定
越升得快跌嗰吓会更应
根本就冇当自己系明星
由始至终我都系普通阿靖
I don't know what you want from me
你估想升真系话咁易
有所不知　最紧要支持
人气急升　大家冷静

who could blame you
I’ve made it so complicated
if I could change you
cause working it out is overrated
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
working it out is overrated
where should I start
no fiction
these are all facts
let’s take it back
to when we first crossed paths
I was 13 you was 20 something
deep in the game
me I didn’t know nothing
took me under your wings
just a kid
no wonder why I worshipped
everything you did
pops said you was bad news
that’s cool
parents just don’t understand
sad but that’s true
it’s like I didn’t have a choice
cause without you
I wouldn’t have a voice
you literally put the
mic in my hand
got on my grind
overtime we
formulated a plan
world domination
that was the goal
2 decades later
watch the story unfold
now it feels like
we’ve finally made it
but when did our relationship
become so complicated
who could blame you
I’ve made it so complicated
if I could change you
cause working it out is overrated
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
working it out is overrated
they say you’ve changed
you ain’t the same
now you’re all about the money
ain’t that a shame
that’s just the half of it
all these accusations
are they accurate
skip substance
you said just put some swag in it
never knew what you
would do to us
if you’ve changed
I guess that makes two of us
grew up as a misguided youth
all you fed me
were lies disguised as the truth
views so distorted
now I see it all clearly
on two different paths
still I love you so dearly
uh huh
our past is undeniable
at one point I was ready to die for you
mixed emotions
running through my head
couldn’t even sleep
when they said that you were dead
false alarm
reports exaggerated
I’m glad you made it through
but man it’s complicated
who could blame
you I’ve made it so complicated
if I could change you
cause working it out is overrated
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love they could overcome
why are you so blind to see
that truth and love
they could overcome
truth and love
they could overcome
working it out is overrated

喂 呢个Mixtape嚟啊 Check it out
打个电话俾个Friend佢真系惊喜 佢一听就话 喂 估唔到系你
佢问我 点解呢排杂志冇见我个样 我话啱啱先至睇到我同Obama副相
今次呢个大选真系重要 我唯有飞十几粒钟 翻去投佢一票
依家唐人会做Rapper 总统系黑人 你话呢个世界真系乜嘢都会发生
HongKong I'm back Fans开始尖叫 当佢知道我今次翻嚟系单程机票
我哋又系埋一齐 留几耐 一个月 一年 或者 一世
几时走 到时先算 我谂住系个娱乐圈兜翻两转
十年前 你同我讲我会上掌门人同曾志伟 我就会即刻答翻你 喂 我谂你有问题
点解我会想上 佢哋估唔到 但系依家上咗之后觉得冇咩嘢唔好
上得去玩 就预咗中计 其实我话做人咁认真又有咩谓
我依家系度做紧实验 谂住出个Mixtape 又睇下反应会点
有人同我讲 你咁做根本系晒气 香港呢个市场你咁做就会冇人理
Mixtape系乜嘢其实佢哋都唔知 简单嚟讲 Mixtape系一只CD
求其拣扎音乐底 然后Rap 不停咁Rap Rap到你甩肺
你罗去买 或者可以罗去派 当做宣传 益晒全世界
免费Rap 咁咪好Cheap No man this is music for the streets

Yo check it out 听住啦
First name Jin 即系我中文名
立字做个青字 睇清楚个名
无论是後生仔或是老饼
多谢你支持 真系唔easy
一个 ABC 要照清楚块镜
佢哋想知点解啲中文会咁正
系咪有个补习老师 not me
由细到大我睇惯TVB
新紮师兄 梁朝伟真系有型
欢乐今宵 何B同郑裕玲
日头晚做就无得停
点讲都好 最紧要系你明
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
你使鬼理我边到出世 只要我有料
一张出世纸点可以做代表
我问你做竹昇有乜咁失礼
就算我系 你都咪当我食塞米
唔觉唔觉系美国住咗24年
我今年24岁真系无乜变
时间过得真系太快
好似无几耐我先至7岁 饮紧维他奶
如果我真系扮我大晒
有怪莫怪 当我细路仔唔识世界
你根本会唔知如果我唔出声
所以我今次一定要系到话过你听
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
你话我唔你正宗唐人 Who are you
距地睇我又咪系黄皮肤
虽然我哋环境系两个唔同世界
但系分别好少 你唔好踩得就踩
八月十五同中秋节
旧历新历根本就无分别
新年流流咪又系逗下利是
饮吓茶打几圈唔系嘅咪锄 D
欧阳靖究竟系边个
你真系想知 最清楚系我
简单来讲 三个字 边三个
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错
You know that’s me
ABC系我系我 横睇点睇都系我 无错无错

somebody tell me why
somebody tell me why
it feels like that we’re here
to just eat, sleep, and die
woke up this mornin’
the first thing to cross my mind
asked myself this question
what am I doing
with my time
on the grind
grindin’ for what
a purpose I don’t even know
I just get up and go
hope for the best
is it a test?
maybe so
so who got the answers
not me but I’m searchin
and I’m certain every person
that is workin’
has a version
of the truth
but what’s the use
without no proof
we just arguin’ to argue
nah I’d rather hit the booth
and let loose
making use of these skills
everyday is real
just trying to pay these bills
is that all there is
or is it something bigger
than taking care of yo business
and counting all your figures
questions keep on comin’
can’t just keep on runnin’
gotta face the music
I do this and I love it
I was put here for a reason
I’m just trying to figure out why
I know one thing
I ain’t here to just
eat sleep and die
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here
to just eat, sleep, and die
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here
to just eat, sleep, and die
you tell yourself
that they don’t know
what’s your plans
and what’s your goals
all that hate
can take it’s toll
what will it take to
save your soul
trying to find some meaning
so you keep on dreaming
which turn to nightmares
they don’t fight fair
still slay your demons
screamin’ for freedom
gotta keep fighting
‘til your destiny is fulfilled
let your guard down
on the battlefield
with a shattered shield
might get yourself killed
I know what you’re thinkin’
you’re the captain of your own ship
so even if it starts sinkin’
no matter what happens don’t trip
don’t take more than you give
what are you leavin’ your kids?
cause even when you’re gone
your legacy will still live
that’s called making an impact
in fact let it be known
that when it’s your time to go
you can’t take anything that you own
that goes for all of us
universal law
he damage has been done
we can’t reverse the fall
you were put here for a reason
trust me that’s no lie
I’m sayin’ though
it can’t be to just
eat, sleep, and die
somebody tell me why
somebody tell me why
it feels like that we’re here to just
eat sleep and die
somebody tell me why
somebody tell me why
it feels like that we’re here
to just eat sleep and die
I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here
to just eat, sleep, and die
I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here
to just eat, sleep, and die
name Eat, Sleep, and Die

Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
I been doin' this for
So long started out with just
A dream
Something told me
Hold on
We gon make
It to the top
Felt the world
Was sleepin' on me
But I never stopped now
They wakin' up to smell the coffee
And it cost me
Whole lotta
Blood sweat and tears just tellin'
My own story
I call it the
Wonder years
Now I got it figured out and its never been
The same
Uh uh
Bring on the money and the fame
That ain't my motivation nah
I'm quite the simple guy
But if I said
I didn't care about it that would be a lie
Maybe I don't fit in
Who am I kiddin'
Been waitin'
My whole life
Just to get in
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
Your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Wait a minute look how far I came
From watching on the sidelines
I'm finally in the game
Now the pressures on but how can I complain'
Ain't this what I wanted tell me
Are you entertained
Cause when I had the crown you were
Claiming that you love me turn around
And put me down
Now you
Thinking nothing of me okay thats cool
God bless you
Amen
I rather have genuine haters
Than a bunch of fake friends
So pardon me
If I choose not to be around ya'll
Just when things are looking up
You hoping for my downfall
15 minutes
And it's going by quick
I know you counting down the seconds like
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you minute is up ohhhh
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you yeah you
Do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you but the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain't goin' nowhere
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you see me
And I ain't goin' nowhere

喂，欧阳靖。
点解你滴都唔系唱hiphot噶
点解无粗口（嘟）
唔系……（嘟）路噶……
我滴歌词无粗口
我唔系爆粗rap友
老人家，小朋友都可以一齐享受
唔系想扮有文化
有时我都会讲下
乜乜乜交叉交叉乜乜乜交叉交叉
但系依家需要控制下自己把口
你知我 rap乜野话题都得 我唔怕丑
anyways 我自己知我自己噶事
好难话完全唔讲 但系尽量讲少滴
边个边个边个知 唔系剩系我留意
好多人 讲讲下野都会加多一个字
 唔小心倒泄 就会变左倒len泄（嘟）
做乜野就会变左做乜len野（嘟）
讲左等于无讲 其实真系好嘥
……（嘟）
全部唔出得街
